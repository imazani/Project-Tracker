# Project-Tracker

This application serves as the backend for a lightweight system aimed at efficiently storing and managing project-related data, including information on projects themselves, the users involved, and any accompanying notes. Utilizing an in-memory H2 database and Spring Data JDBC, it ensures swift and seamless data access.

Future Goals:
With the core business logic established, our next milestone is to develop an intuitive frontend interface. This will enhance the user experience by simplifying data retrieval and entry processes.
