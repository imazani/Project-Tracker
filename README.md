# Project-Tracker

This application serves as the backend for a lightweight system aimed at efficiently storing and managing project-related data, including information on projects themselves, the users involved, and any accompanying notes. Utilizing an in-memory H2 database and Spring Data JDBC, it ensures swift and seamless data access.

Future Goals:
Now that the core business logic has been established, my next objective is to focus on developing the application and presentation layers. This entails creating an intuitive frontend interface and implementing the necessary code for seamlessly inputting new information into the application.
